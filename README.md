# The Journey
## Message

Most of the time, we have our own end goal. Timelines of how we want our lives to turn out, and accomplishments we plan on achieving. This isn't how life works however, as we fall into this endless collection of choices that ultimately decide who we are. As one choice is made, another path of endless possibility closes, until everything seems to finally make sense. These choices are what make us human, and to believe in what they will lead to is divine.

## Inspiration

I've always been a chronic overthinker, over analyzing every situation to only find the best solution through everything. I've started to realize that the best way to live is by simply living, because I can never recover possible choices from the past, only focus on what new ones can create my future.
